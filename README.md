xfce-genmon-scripts<br>
===================<br>
<br>
Scripts for use with the XFCE genmon panel plugin<br>
I made these for use on Xubuntu<br>
I uploaded thses here in the hope they will be useful to others<br>
<br>
<br>
<code>cpu-freq-plugin</code>, <code>cpu-temp</code>, <code>hdd-temp</code>, and <code>temp</code> all use icons from gnome, you can download them <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/ef6ghr6xxg656vc/icons.tar.gz">here</a>, cause I can't figure out how to put a non text file here<br>
Extact it to <code>/</code> it should be merged with it, you will need to do this as root
